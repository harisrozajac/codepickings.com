I want to become a better software developer by learning in public. I want to share what I learn and open source the knowledge I have. In _The Coding Career Handbook_, Shawn Swyx Wang dedicated a whole chapter to learning in public. When I read the chapter, I was motivated to start a blog about my programming path and things that I've learned and that I'm currently learning. Wang points out that people mostly learn in private because that's what we've been taught in school. We get homework, we get grades and we are not allowed to share our knowledge with others. We keep what we learn to ourselves, with the only goal to get the best grades.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not starting this blog to give back to the community. Although went through a service oriented Master of Public Administration program at Brigham Young University and understand the importance of giving back, this blog is not about that. This blog is a way for me to learn and to have a public record of my interests and progress, and I hope that along the way I will build a community of mentors, peers, and supporters.

Finally, I'm sick of just consuming the content and not creating something. I want to be a part of that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)" target="_blank">1% of population that creates content.<a/>
