I’ve started waking up at 4:30 a.m., which is 30 minutes earlier than when I started this morning routine 6 months ago. I’ve learned that waking up early is discouraging because darkness and coldness of the dawn are discouraging. Our minds and bodies prefer warm bad and getting more sleep. Is there anything cozier than a warm bed? Additionally, we love comfort, and waking up early is not comfortable. Yet every day I wake up with a swollen face, trying to overcome the everyday chaos and entropy of my life.

The life is unpredictable, entropy pushes all things toward disorder, and we hear that these are the uncertain times. However, while life tends towards chaos there’s one thing I can predict, which is to get up at 4:30 a.m. and without any distractions open my mind to clarity and light, so I can see the bigger picture, be more conscious of this life that I live, and more anchored in the principles that bring stability and hope.
