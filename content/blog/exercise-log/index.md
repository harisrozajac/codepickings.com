##### 5:30 a.m.

This is something I would do during conditioning period when I was playing soccer. This workout builds strength and endurance because you are not doing your regular 12-15 reps with big breaks. Instead of spending and hour exercising with big breaks, try this sucker for 24 minutes.

Number of sets: 4<br/>
Time for each exercise: 45 second<br/>
Rest between each exercise: 15 seconds<br/>

1. Abs <br/>
2. Side abs <br/>
3. Curls - 25 lbs weights <br/>
4. Back - lay down on your stomach, put your hands behind your back and lift up the upper part of your body and keep both legs on the ground <br/>
5. Push-ups <br/>
6. Abs variation (Normally I would do squats with 25Ibs weights in each hand, but my ankle still hurts from the sprain on Saturday) <br/>
   TOTAL TIME: 24 minutes

##### 7 a.m.

After five days with no exercise, I repeated the same exercise as above. It felt good, except my right quad muscles got sore, because I didn't use them much since spraining my ankle.

Number of sets: 4<br/>
Time for each exercise: 45 second<br/>
Rest between each exercise: 15 seconds<br/>

1. Abs <br/>
2. Side abs <br/>
3. Curls - 30 lbs weights <br/>
4. Back - lay down on your stomach, put your hands behind your back and lift up the upper and lower part of your body and keep both legs on the ground <br/>
5. Push-ups <br/>
6. Squats (my ankle doesn't hurt anymore and the swelling is down) <br/>
   TOTAL TIME: 24 minutes
